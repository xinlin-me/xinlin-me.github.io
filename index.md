<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am Xinting Hu. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [CVMI Lab](https://cvmi.hku.hk/wp-content/uploads/cvmi/index.html), HKU.  

My objective is to develop visual intelligence that can perceive, interpret, and simulate the visual world, with emphasis on: 1) visual learning systems that remain efficient, robust, and continually adaptable; 2) generative modeling with strong multi-view consistency and controllability; and 3) multimodal intelligence that integrates diverse signals to improve reasoning under real-world settings. Besides, I am interested in leveraging AI to advance scientific and medical research.  

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at [MReal Lab](https://mreallab.github.io/), Nanyang Technological University, and conducted postdoctoral research at [D2](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning), Max Planck Institute for Informatics. Before that, I got a B.Eng. degree from USTC.  My biography is available [here](./assets/CV_en.pdf).
